# Team Ate: Team Charter
## Our Purpose and Objective
In the process of developing an app, we want to learn how to work in a group setting while following common practices in the software industry. We ultimately want to build something we're proud of and learn the process of being software engineers.

## Values and Standards
- **RESPECT** Coming from various walks of life, we value everyone's different ideas, backgrounds, and contributions to the team. We're kind and constructive with each other- not desctructive.
- **HONESTY** We're transparent with each other about what we can and can't do. This includes mentioning whether we have or haven't done an assigned task.
- **ENCOURAGE GROWTH MINDSETS** While we're all learning to be software engineers, we want to encourage the opportunities to learn from each other and to learn together.
  
## Expectations
1. Respect each other even in the face of disagreements. We're all trying to solve problems together, and we all are likely to have different approaches.
2. Communicate early and often. Whether it concerns the entire team or your sprint teammates, letting us know sooner rather than later allows us room to plan around absences. It is the individual's responsibility to help your team be aware of any information that you might only know (e.g. the code caused the branch to go haywire, exams are going to eat up time, personal emergencies, etc). It's always okay to ask for help! 
3. Help contribute. We encourage pair/group programming, but it's also good to let everyone get a chance to drive the wheel. Contribution can come in different forms too: providing feedback on another team's work, suggesting ideas, voicing agreement/disagreement, etc.

We acknowledge that the roles within our team are flexible and recognize that there are overlaps in our team members' reponsbilities. That being said, we want to allow for the chance for people to try roles they don't have much exposure to as a chance to learn something new. Of course, depending on the tasks for the week, some primary roles may not be fully acknowledged, and some may be moved to a different role.

During meetings, we also have some specific roles like a note taker and meeting lead.

## Issues, Accountability, and Conflict Resolution
### Identifiable Weaknesses
- Currently, we have a rather free team structure. We allow people to switch roles if they feel they'll be strong in it or simply out of interest. This could lead to some issues when multiple people have largely overlapping tasks, creating uncertainty with individual responsibilities.
- Coming into this class, we all have differing levels of experience with the tech used.

### Accountability and Conflict Resolution
- **ACCOUNTABILITY** During sprints, we split up into teams. Team members should keep each other updated and in check on progress. It's also the individual's responsibility to let their teammates know that they can't get something done or meet up.
  - Should someone need to take frontload or backload work during the week to plan around other classes or personal events to ensure that some work is being done, let the team know.
- **CONFLICT RESOLUTION** Should disagreements occur, we will resolve them with team votes. Of course, each side will get to discuss their side of the arugment so everyone has a balanced perspective of the issue.
- **BROKEN RULES** While we don't anticipate any issues with the team, we have the following protocols in the event someone does not follow team rules or is not doing their assigned work (e.g. freeloading and/or ghosting). Team members should let the team leads know if there are issues.
  1. Talk to the person in question about any issues that were brought up to the leads or observed. We'll resolve this in an understanding way, knowing that personal events and needing to attend to other classes can get in the way. Depending on what happened, this can either be let slide or a warning.
  2. In the event of a repeat offense, we'll be more firm in addressing the issue. Again, depending on how drastic the issue is, this is a warning.
  3. Should another and more serious offense occur, this will lead to escalation with the team's TA after 2-3 warnings. 

## Communication Protocols
Our main form of communication is through the team Slack for any asynchronous conversation. Since we do meet during Tuesdays and Thursdays lectures, after class is a chance for everyone to bring up any concerns when everyone is around.
### Meetings
We generally have two types of meetings: impromptu and scheduled. Impromptu meetings typically occur in the event our members have concerns they want to make the entire team aware of or if any roadblocks come up that may impact the team. Scheduled meetings are guaranteed time for all of us to get together to discuss our plans, answer questions, and ensure we're all on the same page. Since we're understanding that people have responsibilites outside of school, varying schedules, etc, our team does provide the option to join our in-person meetings through a hybrid model by joining a Zoom call.
- (Formerly) Weekly team meetings used to occur on Wednesdays (4:00pm - 4:50pm) in-person to discuss progress and team assignments. During the course of the project, these Wednesday meetings are no longer regularly scheduled and can be used as time for sprint teams to get together. However, if an emergency occurs, we know this is a time slot that could work with the majority of the team.
- Barring any events that would force us to move days, our weekly sprint schedule is as follows:
  - Mondays = Sprint Planning (in-person) @ 2:00pm.
  - Saturdays = Sprint Review + Retrospective (remote via Zoom) @ 5:00pm.
  - Stand-ups: as of now, our team has decided to plan our stand-ups for every other day (Wednesday, Friday, Sunday with Monday being our sprint planning meeting). This schedule allows our team to breathe without having an expectation that they'll be dedicating their time to this project everyday as we all have other classes and life going on. These check-ins are how we keep everyone accountable and making sure that some form of progress is being made.
- Sprint teams should plan their own meetings that works best with the team's schedule. The meetings being online or in-person doesn't matter so long as everyone on the team is okay with it.

##### Meetings Summary
| What | When | Where |
| ---- | ---- | ----  |
| Sprint Planning | Every Monday @ 2:00pm | In-person @ Sixth College RWAC |
| Sprint Review + Retrospective | Every Saturday @ 5:00pm | Remote via Zoom |
| Stand-ups | Every other day (Wed, Fri, Sun) | Asynchronous via Slack |

### Absences
- The team does not necessarily need to be aware of lecture absences. Just know the individual should be aware of missed lecture content and missed an in-class exercise (if applicable). Do note that the team sometimes conducts impromptu meetings after class.
- For team-wide or sprint team meetings, let the team know as soon as you find out you can't make it. If this is a meeting where tasks are assigned, do be aware task assignment priority goes to those who are present with the absentees being assigned whatever needs to be filled left.
