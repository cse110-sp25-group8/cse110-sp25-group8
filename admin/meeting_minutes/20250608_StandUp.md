| Arlene Garcia     | I helped Ashley and Chanbin with the image data and then started writing the readme file. | |
| Ashley Vo         | Yesterday, I worked with Chanbin and Arlene to help fix image data not being handled correctly when editing an existing recipe. Then I worked with Kiara on writing IndexedDB tests for the RecipeStore interface. | |
| Chanbin Na        | | |
| Dorje Pradhan     | I installed Jest and Babel and configured them so we could set up our testing environment the same as lab 7. I added some unit tests for localStorageService and made some styling changes on the create recipe page that was recommended by Powell the other day after class. Later tonight Iâ€™ll help Chanbin finish merging all the branches and deploy our project. | |
| Kiara Singh       | I worked on the tests for the database with Ashley to test out the various different functions. | |
| Kiet Dang         | I worked on validation for the create/edit recipe form. | |
| Minahil Yasar     | | |
| Patrick Thant     | I wrote the unit testing for localStorage (including filtering). I left out the filter by Ingredient test because it seems like the `50-cicd-testing-..` branch did not branched from our `sprint4-filter`. The one that me, Kiara and Minahil worked on. I will now work on implementing the filtering for favorite in sprint4-filter, which shouldn't take long. And merge it into 50-cicd-testing-... and write the test for ingredient. | |
| Ryan Awal         | Worked with Samson and Shashwat to create the GitHub action for generating JSDocs | |
| Samson Gebrekidan | I worked with Shashwat and Ryan on creating the JSDoc generation GitHub action. We also finished adding comments to all the JavaScript files | |
| Shashwat Dudeja   | Me, Samson and Ryan are trying to make the GitHub Action for JSDoc generation but the GitHub Actions don't have access to read and write on the repo so it can't generate the documentation right now. (Later fixed). | |
