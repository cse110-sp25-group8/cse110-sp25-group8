### Project Brainstorming Discussion
Rashi's information:

The below is a suggested roadmap to follow for our project brainstorming phase. Don't skip any steps, meaning- don't start with user personas and shoehorn your idea to fit with those (as an example).

> Research -> finalize a domain -> do user personas (identify different users and their problems/expectations from this app) -> finalize a target audience (you don’t want to cater to all users - we don’t have so much time, so stick to one group of users) -> brainstorm on different features (no idea is a bad idea here) -> narrow down the features to a final, realistic feature stack -> wireframe/fat marker sketches

- If we really want, we have the okay to do a game since we did pretty well on the warm-up (i.e. got the game working in 1 week).

## Questions, Concerns, Comments
The following questions were answered by Rashi:
| Type | Description | Response |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Question | If we started with five general ideas in our brainstorm but narrowed it down to two because we liked the topics, is it okay if we only did heavy research on those two but scrapped the others? | Yeah, that's actually a good approach (she likes it). |
| Question | We came up with a recipe idea... we see that Lab 6 is recipe based.  Is that okay or do we need a new idea? | <ul><li>It shouldn't be an issue as long as we make our project of a much larger scope than the lab. **However**, we should be aware that another team *is* planning to do something recipe based as well (Note that this is a team overseen by Rashi, so there could be even more throughout the entire class).</li><li>I gave her the gist of our idea and she did like it. She did suggest: taking user input of their inventory (pantry) and using some "intelligence" (not necessarily AI- it can be as simple as string matching) to determine the best recipes. She did note that this idea would be really fitting for our team since we're called "Team Ate."</li></ul> |
| Question | <ol><li>Are we supposed to be finished with the pitch on Monday, or do we need the pitch also *approved* as well?</li><li>How would we show this to the TA? Does it need to be synchronously or asynchronously?</li></ol> | <ol><li>She would like to see something by Sunday night or Monday morning before we submit. The pitch itself does not need to be formally complete so long as we have the main features down and our Miro board with wireframes.</li><li>This check-up can be done asynchronously (e.g. pinging her on Slack).</li></ol>  |

## Other Notes & Information
- If we have any other questions, feel free to just ping Rashi on Slack.
- Ideally, we should plan to have an additional brainstorming session on top of today's (4/24) meeting. Over the weekend, we might have to dedicate 2-3 hours together to put our pitch together, but we'll have to see the team's availability.
