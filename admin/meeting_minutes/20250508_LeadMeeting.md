## Agenda
| Discussion Item |
| ---- |
| [CI/CD](#cicd) |
| [ADR](#adr) |

### CI/CD
- Not a short implementation-- we're going to expect to modify this in stages.
- Phase 1: This week
  - For us, set up linting checks and enforcing PR code reviews.
    - Protect our main branch. At least two people who have *not* worked on that branch should review any PRs. 
  - GitHub Actions > .yaml file
- Looking to the future:
  - Phase 2: next week when we have code
    - Unit Tests
      - People should be writing unit tests (Test driven development)
    - Documentation (JSDocs) - adding comments
      - We need enough comments but not too many (our CSS in the warm-up had way too many and it looked obvious it was generated by an LLM)
  - Phase 3: Code coverage (Codacy), e2e (if you have time)

### ADR
- Follow a format of:
    - Context/Problem
    - Options Considered
    - Decision & Outcome
    - Pros & Cons
- This is more so about our project decisions (e.g. what database we're using, code structure, how we test, etc).
- Versioning: 
  - Naming convention: 1.[# decision].[decision version]
- **Our first one can be about our finalized features and their assigned priorities. Also include stuff about the target audience.**

### Other 
#### Branching Strategy
- 1 per feature

#### Project Strategy
- General process for Sprints starting next week 
Kanban Board (Git Project Mgmt) -> Create Tasks -> convert into gitHub Issues (follow issue templates) -> assign them to people -> create feaature branches for issues -> PRs for merging them into main (CI/CD should be triggered) -> close issue -> mark it as "done" on the board 
- 2 meetings for sprints: beginning (planning) and end (retrospective)
- Asynchronously daily updates for our sprints (ideally, yes, this is supposed to be daily, but if it doesn't work out for our team, we might have to move it to every 2 days).
  - We'll need to document and formalize our sprint meetings.


## Questions, Concerns, Comments
The following questions were answered by Rashi:
| Type | Description | Response |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Question | (CI/CD) How exactly are we implementing a linter and tests since we haven't started programming yet? | Answered: see [CI/CD](#cicd) |
| Question | (ADR) How do these differ from our meeting notes because we do kind of make decisions in our meetings and write them down there? | Create a separate file for that decision made even if it's in the meeting notes. |
| Question | (ADR) Is there an expectation of 4 ADRs by Checkpoint 1 or is 4 ADRs for the entire project? | Up to us, but we should follow a process. At least one should be in our repo this week. | 

## Other Notes & Information
- TO DO:
  - Plan planning sprint meeting (Monday?)
  - Plan ending (reflection/review) sprint meeting (Saturday/Sunday?).
