| Arlene Garcia     | I finished the task on Tuesday and have been looking at UI design and IndexDB documentation | |
| Ashley Vo         | I wrote a ton of documentation! Hopefully this eases and guides the way forward for Patrick and me to implement the actual interface, which we plan on doing tomorrow! Here's also a sneak peek of said "immaculate documentation"  | |
| Chanbin Na        | I also worked with Dorje and Shashwat, implementing the dark mode design and CSS. We first made the dark mode framework and then used those design, we adjusted the CSS based on that. Also, I will refactor pages js as Rashi recommended today and tomorrow. | |
| Dorje Pradhan     | I worked on the UI of the details page although I haven’t touched the timer. I also worked with Chanbin and Shashwat to begin implementing the dark mode color scheme. Currently, it will only switch to dark mode if your browser is set to dark mode. I will work on adding a toggle button (probably next to the favorites button) so you can switch manually between dark and light mode whenever you’d like! | |
| Kiara Singh       | I’ve been reviewing the UI choices in the other channel. Our team finished with their task by the tuesday deadline. | |
| Kiet Dang         |  | |
| Minahil Yasar     | I worked on the CSS for the timer and will check in with Ryan tomorrow to make sure we’re done with our task | |
| Patrick Thant     | Today, i got a chance to dive deep into IndexDB and made some architectural suggestions upon Rashi's suggestions (all thanks to Ashley's immaculate documentation on it). We planned to try implementation tmr. | |
| Ryan Awal         | Today I worked on the js part of the timer. Now Mina will handle the CSS and we’ll check in to see if everything is as expected | |
| Samson Gebrekidan |  | |
| Shashwat Dudeja   | I worked on refining css and refactoring the html from the add recipe page to JS with dorje and chanbin | |
