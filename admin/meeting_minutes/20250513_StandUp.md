## Stand Up
Since we reecently got feedback from Professor Powell, we decided to do a stand-up about the team's thoughts about the feedback and suggestions for direction.

| Member            | Suggestion 1 |  Suggestion 2 |
| ----              | ----         | ---- |
| Arlene Garcia     | I am thinking for the timer feature it could be added maybe to the side of the step that requires the timer instead of being a big timer at the bottom of the recipe. That way the user can just click on the timer when they get to that step | A feature I have thought of is if we have a step by step mode outside of just the recipe card so that it only shows one step at a time fullscreen and then you can see the timer for that step. You can go to the next step by pressing a button and maybe the ingredients could be displayed on the side. | 
| Ashley Vo         | I think adding preferences/settings would be a fantastic addition (from Professor's suggestions).. a lot of apps have that feature, so it's less work for the user if the app "remembers" what the user likes (e.g. I want my recipes to always be in list view, I want my app to always be in dark theme, etc). | I guess this is more of a bit both of a question and suggestion-- I'm a little confused on how the filters work: was the idea that there's a fixed amount of filters that display and the user has to set them to some value (e.g. "Breakfast" for filter #1)? And if they needed more, more filters would get added (e.g. filter 5, 6, ...)? Just a thought: maybe have a menu or sidebar that handles filters or maybe integrate it into a search menu? |
| Chanbin Na        | The professor also mentioned a different view mode in today’s meeting. Adding a list view alongside our current card view could be helpful, especially for mobile users. We could also give users the option to expand a card to full width, displaying one recipe at a time. | I think there’s still room for improvement on the view recipe page. Since our main content is the recipe itself rather than the timer, we should make the recipe steps more prominent. For example, enlarging the step number and displaying it as a circle with our accent color, similar to the image I shared, could improve the design and user focus. I think there could be other better arrangements that would make the main recipe stand out more, and I might play around with it more, but this is what I can think of for now. |
| Dorje Pradhan     | For the UI of the “view recipe” page, I agree with what prof Powell mentioned about the timer. I think if we shrink it to the size of the little card that’s in the top left corner and place it right underneath there (bottom/middle left side). | I think we should also make the translation and unit conversion a high priority feature. Without it, our potential audience is limited to pretty much English speaking Americans which would be a shame. |
| Kiara Singh       | I think it's a bit of a hassle to scroll for the timer so it would be better to either have a smaller one kind of on the screen stuck there so it stays even when we scroll. Or something to make it more available. | A feature I'd like is more customization on the way it looks since UI is so important, so maybe night mode/color schemes (if we have time!). |
| Kiet Dang         | I also find the personalization setting is actually a good thing, such as "Dark mode" and "Language" settings. Not everyone knows/comfortable with English, so having a couple widely spoken languages such as Chinese, Spanish, German, etc., is a core feature. | I also agree with Dorje and unit conversion. Arbitrarily, I don't even used imperial units, and the rest of the worlds don't, so having unit conversion is also necessary. |
| Minahil Yasar     | For the add recipe page,  we could have an autofill feature. So if a user is adding a similar recipe, the app could suggest filling in the cook times or instructions so the user doesn't have to write everything from scratch. | Also I think the voice recognition is a good idea because it's really annoying to use your phone when cooking. To add to this, we could also have a widget on the lock screen that shows you how much time is left as well |
| Patrick Thant     | timer on mobo, right now users will need to scroll all the way down, like as if it's a hidden feature. People will rarely use it in that case. We will have to reconsider about the timer design on mobo for both easier accessibility, and usability while not making it prominent. | The browse files section on add recipe page is way too big on mobo. I know that it's because window has drag&drop feature, but mobo doesn't need drag&drop. |
| Ryan Awal         | I think adding a hover or long press view for cards in the home page should show all the different filter tags associated with that recipe - can also implement ingredient exclusion to cater to dietary restrictions and allergies | Progressive recipe steps (like swiping to the next step rather than having all instructions and timers on the same page) would be more intuitive to use in my opinion - especially on phones |
| Samson Gebrekidan | I would say the recipe cards on the Home Page all look very similar. To make them easier to scan, we could add small tags or icons on each card for example a leaf for “Vegetarian,” and so on. | How about adding a feature that lets users filter recipes by country? For example, if someone selects “Italian,” it would show Italian cuisine, or if they choose “Ethiopian,” it would show Ethiopian dishes, and so on. |
| Shashwat Dudeja   | I think having the time required for cooking the recipe being on the front page would be a very nice and important feature as our target audience, college students, are very commonly in a rush. I think having the macros and calories on the front page would also be nice for more health focused users. | The serving size feature we discussed would also be a useful feature where users can adjust it and the ingredient amounts and perhaps, the calories and macros change automatically. |
