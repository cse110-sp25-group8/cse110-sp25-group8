## Retrospective
In this retrospective, we decided to do a hybrid reflection of both this past sprint, the team, the quarter, and the project. We went with the "Mad, Sad, Glad" template on Retrium to categorize our feelings and thoughts.

### Mad >:(
#### Stress and Time Limitations
- A lot of little things needed to be handled without being given enough time- considering everyone was extremely busy this week and the next (context: week 10 and finals week).
- This week was so busy for most of us... it was hard to managing all the different stuff.
- While important, we did have a lot of meetings, so it felt constrained by the amount of time in general
- Having CSE110 along with other classes felt frustrating and it felt like I wasn't giving this class enough importance as it deserved
- There's still so much work to do right at the end :'(
- I'm just tired :( I just want a good night's sleep for once.
- It's a really busy week and on top of midterms + re-do midterm we have the video and final code push which is feeling like a lot
- I was mad because I couldn't help as much as I could.

### Sad :(
#### Project Scope
- Not a lot of sprints so the scope of the project had to be narrowed down.
- I was disappointed that we didn't have enough time to include all the features we wanted.

#### Expectations
- I feel like I did a decent amount of work.. but if the TA were to grade us using the # of commits... it's unfair, considering we had a lot of merging issues, and copy pasting codes from other branch, and deleting the branches. I am sure everyone did their jobs as well.
- I was frustrated whenever we got stuck or new requirements kept being added.

### Glad :)
#### The Team
- I am glad that I found a good group
- Team's pretty chill- we all seem to get along for the most part
- I am glad that I had the chance to work with everyone on the team. Shoutout to Ashley and Chanbin for being amazing leads.
- Everyone communicated well and I liked working with all of you!
- I am glad that we were still able to work on the project as a team even though we all had a packed schedule for finals.
- Groups still seem to be functioning at the final sprint despite busy schedules with finals coming up!

#### Project Productivity
- Rewarding to apply the final touches.
- Overall a pretty good project and I'm glad it's over!!!!
- The project felt productive and we got to see something come to life!
- Reduced workload once the class is over.
- We kinda get all the core features that we want to include.

## Other Notes & Information
- Return on Time Invested (ROTI) score: 3.1 ($n = 7$).
