| Arlene Garcia     | I worked with Kiara, Kiet, and Samson to implement the add recipe card feature to display the recipes from local storage on the homepage. | |
| Ashley Vo         | So far, I've gotten some general resources about IndexedDB and wrote down some ideas for functions that would be helpful for the interface. I'm looking to refining some research details, being more specific about potential functions, and maybe playing around with a test interface. | |
| Chanbin Na        | I worked on refining CSS for the main page and also created a recipe page. After the recipe card implementation team was finished, I applied the changed CSS to that. Also, with Dorje, we worked on making a team status video together. For the video part, I filmed the demo part and then edited the video. | |
| Dorje Pradhan     | I worked with Chanbin to make the team status video! While he was polishing up the featured feature and recorded the demonstration, I worked on creating the slides and recording the more general information required. | |
| Kiara Singh       | I worked on fixing up the recipe card implementation, integrating JS to the correct pages, making the form functional and displaying recipes from local storage. I worked with Kiet, Arlene and Samson| |
| Kiet Dang         | Mission: survive, Goal: Finish the task with Arlene, Kiara and Samson, Consequence: I lost my voice the day after, but we balling. | |
| Minahil Yasar     | I will work with Ryan on implementing the timer on Friday | |
| Patrick Thant     | I won't be able to work on the project until later tmr. I have another final project coming up for the other class as well. I will work on researching IndexDB tmr. | |
