| Arlene Garcia     | I finished the repository cleanup (adding pull request templates to old prs, deleting old branches) and worked on edit/deleting functions of the cards. For edit I got most of the inputs to autofill from the database and now we just need to link the pages and make sure it works as it should. | |
| Ashley Vo         | I haven't done anything since the last check-in but I do plan on tackling unit testing for our IDB interface tomorrow | |
| Chanbin Na        | | |
| Dorje Pradhan     | | |
| Kiara Singh       | Today I finished up the filtering for cuisine, category, time and made sure that it shows all recipe if the original label is chosen. I also added a scroll feature so only a certain amount of ingredients are shown in that dropdown. I also cleaned up the code so I fixed comment locations and removed the shuffle button. | |
| Kiet Dang         | | |
| Minahil Yasar     | Worked on the CSS for the ingredient filter to display the checked ingredients correctly | |
| Patrick Thant     | Hello, Kiara, Minahil, and and Me almost finished with the filtering. We just need to do some styling and modify the display recipe by filter function to be able to filter out for (cuisine, category, time estimate) which is just extra 3 if statements. | |
| Ryan Awal         | Worked with Chanbin and Arlene on the edit and delete functionality. | |
