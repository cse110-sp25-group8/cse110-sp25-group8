### Team Overview & Overhaul of Strategy
- Maybe have 1 or 2 people dedicated to SWOT notes.
- Split Part 1 into  managable parts that can be given out to teams
  - Make card objects one-by-one (all cards will share the same back-side)
- Naive approach first then focus on details (appearance). 

#### Task 1 Details
- Idea: Get people to write down basic functionalities of the cards 
  - For example: "This card needs to flip. It has a value. It has a suite" and so on.
- HTML first --> CSS and JS afterwards.

### Availabilities

- Minahil, Ryan, Phyo, and Kiet have quizzes on Friday.

### Tomorrow's Meeting
- Together, break down TASK 1.
  - For now and before tomorrow's meeting, think of and write ideas.
  - Go over CSS and JS to your best ability.
