## Retrospective

We first collected our group's idea of what went well and what didn't go well this week. 

### Planning and communication

#### What Went Well?
- The sprint planning is pretty useful, we get to brainstorm with everyone, and get a clear picture or what we are supposed to be working on over the week.
- Honest communication about our progress and making decent strides toward our goals for the week. 
  
#### What Didn't Went Well?
- I think we could go standups every 2 days instead of 1 day 

> Not everyone was able to work projects everyday.

### Working in groups

#### What Went Well?
- Spliting into smaller groups allowed our group to learn more about html and css and how to work together better
- Working in small groups. I think the way we divided the tasks was great.
- Smaller teams for work allowed us to complete tasks quicker.
- Subteams split well, everyone took ownership of their tasks.
- We were able to complete our team tasks and we worked well together. I liked the small teams because we could help each other out and it was easier to plan meetups
- Working with a team makes me learn more
- We were able to get a working html and had good collaboration
- Collaboratively, we work along well and there are a lot of common ground between us.

#### What Didn't Go Well?
- Scheduling times to work together was a bit of a struggle so finding a way to asynchronously work might be more productive and working solo could also be an option to consider
- Started a bit late - so felt a bit rushed to get anything meaningful done - difficult to accomodate schedules of three people
- Maybe sometimes we were not available at the same time which made it hard to finish tasks quickly

> Majority of people liked the smaller group. Working ascyncronously in small group could be one good option if the schedule doesn't line up well. Solo work could be one option but it should be avoided. Pairs would be really good option. 

### Feedback

#### What Didn't Go Well?
- TA moved the goal posts at the end of the week
- A lot of suggestions and feedback from Rashi and Powell kind of threw us for a loop. 

> It was tough hearing that we had extra work to do after working other stuff. We need to make it clear that what we can do and what we can't do. We should think feedback on improving project not as assigned extra work. 

### CSS or Tech for generalizing
#### What Didn't Go Well?
- At frist, we were having trouble with branches and working with Github but once we figured it out it was good. The CSS part took us a while to figure out but eventually we did. 
- We got stuck on css and were not able to figure out even after a long time

> As a group go over CSS more. As lots of the styling is shared, we can communicate and combine some part that could be combined. 

### Github Issue
#### What Didn't Go Well?
- We should use Github Issue and also Projects

> We should use Github Project to assign tasks and also link each issue each branches to its corresponding branch to make our workflow more visual and organized. 

## Reflecting Retro
Out of the 5 different option (1. Definetely not worth our time, 2. Probably not worth our time, 3. Worth our time, 4. A good use of our time, 5. An excellent use of our time) our team got **average 3.4**, meaning most of people thought that pretty decent use of our time.
