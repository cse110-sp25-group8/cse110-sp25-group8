| Arlene Garcia     | | |
| Ashley Vo         | Working with Patrick on the IndexedDB interface! Got IDBService.js and RecipeStore.js done, and we're working on the other files right now so it's... almost done- just some architectural stuff we're running into. Need to create JSDocs for it and possibly unit test it. | |
| Chanbin Na        | I worked on refactoring the page JS. Finished refactoring for the home.js and detail.js part refactoring. | |
| Dorje Pradhan     | I started and almost finished the mobile UI for the add recipe page (very long phones like the iPhone 14 will hide the buttons at the bottom of the page beyond what you can scroll), changed the mobile UI header so the search bar is on it's own line with small icons for the add recipe and shuffle buttons next to it, and added a dark mode toggle switch to the header. The chosen theme (dark mode or light mode) will be saved in local storage so that the user's preference is saved between pages, refreshes, and future visits. | |
| Kiara Singh       | Iâ€™ve been reading the docs and notes we have on indexDB. Finished my work for the week already. | |
| Kiet Dang         | I worked on input validation today. Need to work on validating "Instructions" input. Current trouble is if one of the instructions step is an empty string, we shouldn't parse it to JSON format.  | |
| Minahil Yasar     | I completed the implementation of the correct timer CSS | |
| Patrick Thant     | I worked on local storage, synchronizing with IndexDB, tgt with Ashley. For now, we have update, insert, delete, and filter. Filter is not fully implemented yet since we are thinking about new architect for ingredient tags | |
| Ryan Awal         | | |
| Samson Gebrekidan | I worked on adding the recipe card on Tuesday and now, I am focusing on researching about IndexedDB to better understand it. | |
