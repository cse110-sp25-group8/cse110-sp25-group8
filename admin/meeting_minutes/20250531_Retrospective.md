### What Went Well
#### Team Dyamics
- Working in slightly bigger groups is more helpful
  - How we divided our task was pretty solid
- Teams were still able to make progress with hectic schedules. Gonna make sure the work taken on is completed by the sprint's end.
- Other teams communicated well when they needed help or had something to share.
- Bonded through the struggles
  
#### Insight
- We got a lot of (SWE) insight from making design decisions each with their pros and cons

### What Didn't Go Well
#### Scheduling
- More asysc tasks and dividing within teams could be better.
- As it is almost the last of the quarter, it's getting harder to find the time for a team meeting.
- We didn't get lots of chances to work on the earlier of the week, as the task was so dependent on team 1

#### Time Estimation
- The estimated time to do things took a lot longer than expected as things ended up being harder and filled with room for error
- It was hard to know how long a task would take and I think we didn't distribute enough people for certain tasks, but that's hard to predict and just comes from experience.

## Other Notes & Information
- Return on Time Invested (ROTI) score: 3.6 ($n = 5$).
