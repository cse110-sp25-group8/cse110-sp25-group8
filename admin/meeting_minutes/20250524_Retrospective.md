### What Went Well
#### Help and Teams
- Working in small teams was helpful for developing features like adding a card.
- We could learn a lot from each other and ask questions when confusion arises.

#### Meeting and Planning
- Meeting times are easy to figure out for our team, and we've been pretty flexible.
- Making a plan to do things is a lot easier than jumping straight in. It's also a good reference and starting point for everyone else to be on the same page and reading from the same source (single source of truth!!!).

#### Task Progress
- We were able to make decent progress. Being able to complete some form of demo inspired confidence that our app is coming to life, which helps with motivation as we approach the end.
- Everyone helped set goals and worked well together to finish the task and help each other. Goals were accomplished.

#### Stand-ups
- Having stand-ups every other day instead of everyday felt more useful as we felt that there was something more meaningful we could report.

### What Didn't Go Well
#### Planning, Timing, and Roadblocks
- With us trying to catch up on the project, it felt like we didn't get the chance to plan the demo video in advance, so time felt like it was a limiting factor in terms of deadlines and knowing what to do or not to do for the video.
  - Technical difficulties added more stress to the video deadline.
- Documentation and research are larger timesinks than anticipated.
- It felt that we could have more asynchronous meetings since people are getting more busy, so letting people fill in their statuses on their own time feels more flexible.
  - However, we did agree that having everyone together synchronously makes it easier to bounce off of each other's idea in live time rather than waiting for someone to reply. Clarification can also be done in real time rather than misinterpreting a message. So, we can keep stand-ups async, but reviews and retros seem to be helpful to be together.

## Other Notes & Information
- Return on Time Invested (ROTI) score: 4.0 ($n = 6$).
