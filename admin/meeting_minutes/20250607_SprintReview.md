## Sprint Review
| Who     | Task(s)                       | Comments  | 
| ----    | ----                          | ---- |
| Arlene  | Recipe details, Repo clean-up | On the repository clean-up team: pull-requests template and added them to old pull requests. Worked on the edit/delete, but image issues are appearing with editing. | 
| Ashley  | CI/CD                         | Ran into issues about editing recipes not showing. Moved to help Chanbin and Arlene to identify the issue. Has not tackled unit testing for the DB yet.  | 
| Chanbin | Recipe details, CI/CD         | Worked on the editing and delete portions with Arlene and Ryan. Ran into the image issues (see Arlene's comments). | 
| Dorje   | CI/CD                         | Set up Jest like lab 7 and Babel. It should be the same syntax like the lab. | 
| Kiara   | Filtering                     | Filters should work now and Mina did some CSS. The CSS looks good. The only thing left is implement the favorites feature filtering. Multiple things can be selected for ingredient filtering. | 
| Kiet    | Repo clean-up                 | Worked on merging the branches for `sprint4-starter`. | 
| Minahil | Filtering                     | Worked on CSS for ingredients filter. When the user clicks on the filter, it should show up on the right side. Progress is in `sprint4-filter`. | 
| Patrick | Filtering                     | Worked on the ingredient filter for multiple selection and the JavaScript for it. Worked on `sprint4-filter`. | 
| Ryan    | Recipe details, CI/CD         | Worked with Arlene and Chanbin on edit and delete. Had to leave during the editing portion, but made sure to look at the code. | 
| Samson  | CI/CD                         | With the testing team.  | 
| Shash   | Repo clean-up                 | Created the `sprint4-starter` branch and added the `.gitignore` file. | 

### CI/CD Team
localStorage and IndexedDB interfaces need to be tested. JSDocs should be prioritized as well.
- Dorje created two simple unit tests for localStorage. Patrick offered to help.
- Ashley and Kiara could try to tackle IDB testing. 
- Kiet on validation tests e.g. limit minutes to three digit number of minutes.

JSDocs generation:
  - Shash could try later tonight (6/7). Samson could also help Shash.
