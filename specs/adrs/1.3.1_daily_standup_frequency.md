## Context/Problem
Right now, the team has mixed feelings about standups being daily. We discussed that not everyone will be doing work on the project daily, so there wouldn't be any useful updates for the team given the daily schedule. Most of us have other classes to focus on and can only work on the project on specific days. 

## Options Considered
- Everyday
- Every other day

## Decision & Outcome
We all agreed that stand-ups should be **every other day**.

## Pros & Cons
Based on our decision, what are the tradeoffs we acknowledge?

### Pros
- People are more likely to have updates to tell the team since people have other things to focus on.
- Having it less often would encourage more consistent participation from everyone.
- We'll alleviate the stress from everyone so that there isn't an expectation that they'll make meaningful progress per day (especially considering that we're all taking different classes).

### Cons
- If they work everyday, then they don't get the chance to update us on that via the stand-up.
