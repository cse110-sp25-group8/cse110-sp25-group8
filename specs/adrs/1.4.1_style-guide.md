## Context/Problem
At the end of our project, our code should look like it was written by one person. While we do have a linter for JavaScript, the team should also be mindful of general styling. 

## Style Rules
### HTML
- Always use semantic tags first (e.g. `<search>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, etc) before considering `<div>`.
- Tags should always be closed, even if they are void elements e.g. `<img/>`.

### CSS
- Use `kebab-case` for naming IDs and classes.
- Curly braces should be opened on the same line as the selector.
- Always indent with tab (4 spaces on VSCode).
- Add a space after the selector and colon e.g. `color: #FFFFFF`.

### JavaScript
#### Good Usage
- Never use `var`. Use `let` or `const` instead as appropriate.
- Always use strict equality (`===`), never loose equality (`==`) to avoid type coercion.

#### Naming and Identifiers
- All function and variable names should be in `lowerCamelCase`.
- Constants should be in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, also known as `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. A constant is defined as a variable that uses the `const` keyword.
- Classes should be named in `UpperCamelCase`.

#### Formatting
- Opening braces should be on the same line for any function, control block (e.g. `for` loops and `if` statements), and class definition.
- When commenting, always put a space after the `//`.
- Always indent with tab (4 spaces on VSCode).
