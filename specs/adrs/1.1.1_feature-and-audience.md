### Target Audience
- College students
- Workers
- New parents
- New home cooks

## Decision & Outcome
### Features
We decided to pull the top three voted features on our poll. We also talked to Professor Powell to prioritize our options.

#### High Priority
Offline access is a given. These are options we think are usable and necessary for our app.

1. Create and display a recipe card: this is the basis of our app.
   - Deleting a card. 
2. Filtering for time, food types, and (maybe) ingredients: users should be able to *look* through their collection 
3. Shuffling for a random recipe: an alternative method to searching
4. JSON-LD: schema.org recipe scheme so that recipes can be loaded or downloaded to storage.

#### Medium Priority
These would be nice extras as utility for the user, but not necessary given our time constraints (Iron Triangle!).

1. Favoriting: the user is creating their own recipes
2. Built-in step timers: nice for the user to not have to go to another timer.

#### Low Priority
These are just extra fluff that would be "nice to have" but not necessary for functionality/utility.

To be added later.

### Audience
We decided on **college students**.

## Pros & Cons
Pros
- Using the iron triangle we know that our time is constrained so we have to priorities what features are feasible in the 3.5 weeks we have. 
- Easy to use and follow for beginners 

Cons
- Don't get to all our features.
- Program might not be as complex or unique compared to current recipe apps
- Uses local storage so if deleted all data would be lost 
- Just focusing on high priorities could cause us to not even reach medium priorities
