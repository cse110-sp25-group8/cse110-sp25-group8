## Context/Problem
Originally, we were only planning on using IndexedDB for all storage concerns i.e. for our recipe data.

## Options Considered
- IndexedDB (only)
- IndexedDB + localStorage
    - IndexedDB for more thorough recipe data. 
    - localStorage for metadata to be used in querying.
 
## Decision & Outcome
We'll use the combination of IndexedDB and localStorage.

## Pros & Cons
Based on our decision, what are the tradeoffs we acknowledge?

### Pros
- localStorage has fast access. For something like querying and filtering on the main page, we don't need complex data. We can store metadata in localStorage i.e. the specific data that we care about when we filter.
  - We can also expand upon our metadata later without depending on IDB e.g. if we want to add some sorting by "Recently viewed."
- We don't call the IndexedDB API every time. This reduces the overhead of our app as IDB has to set up transactions and whatnot under the hood.

### Cons
- We'll need to create a custom interface for handling localStorage metadata and querying.
