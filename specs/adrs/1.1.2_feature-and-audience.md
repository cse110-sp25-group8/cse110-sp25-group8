## Context/Problem
The topic of the issue we're coming to a resolution for. 

## Options Considered
What the team has suggested and/or researched.

## Decision & Outcome
### Features
| Feature | About | Notes | Priority |
| -----   | ----  | ----  | ----     |
| Progressive Steps | Turn each step into a card that can be swiped left or right (one step = one card). |  This would only be useful with voice recognition (e.g. "Next step")... so we probably won't do it. | **Low** |
| Long press to view more details (tags) | Pressing and holding will show more information about the recipe such as its entire tag list | No identifiable use case as we already have a view recipe page. | **Low** |
| File uploading (JSON) | Allow users to upload JSON files that contain recipe data. | The average person probably doesn't even know what JSON is and probably does not have a use for the JSON file. | **Low** |
| Unit Conversion | Offer a setting to convert from the imperial measurement system to metric (vice cersa) | We considered the fact that users are inputting their own recipes, which is the intention of the app. We asked whether or not this feature would be commonly used. Since it's offline, unit conversion is not important but would be useful in the case that recipes are shared. Verdict: Not important for our *current* scope. | **Low** |
| Voice Recognition for Commands | Allow the user to use their voice to issue commands such as "start a timer for five minutes" or "read me the next step." | Hands can get dirty when cooking. The good side of this is that users could use the recipe app hands-free while cooking. We all have mixed feeling because of privacy concerns and the team feels like the use case is rather niche as devices typically already come with some smart assistant feature (Siri, Alexa, Google, Cortana, etc). We would have to come up certain voice commands that can be recognized. | **Low** |
| Translation/Localization | There are two known options available to us: 1) Offer translation for the UI elements only or 2) Apply some API (such as Google Translate) to translate the entire page | We likely won't be having a large userbase. For non-English speakers, they are already likely to be typing their recipes out in their native language, so the only translation/localization we would need is for the UI (e.g. "Search", "Options", etc). Additionally, for our desktop users, Chrome is a browser that comes in with auto-translate functionality. | **Medium** |
| Serving Sizes | For some input $x$ number of servings, adjust the ingredients list to reflect the number of items needed. | This would be helpful for users needing to meal prep or cook for others. Reducing the math the user needs to do and allowing our app to do it would be time saving utility. | **Medium** | 
| Screen Sleep Off | Recipe websites often have a toggle to keep your device screen from going dark (also known as going to sleep). This is annoying to deal with when cooking when a user needs to reference instructions. This should be a toggeable feature on each recipe page. | We all generally agreed it would be useful for the user to not be inconvenienced by screens turning off. Note this is an API (See [Screen Wake Lock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API)). | **Medium** |
| Different View Sizes for Recipe Cards | When recipe cards are displayed on the main screen, the user should have a choice in how they want to see their recipes. Maybe they want to see big cards, small cards, or a list view (think the different view types in MacOS Finder or Windows File Explorer). | No questions asked- we all acknowledged this is an essential accessibility feature. | **High** |
| Text-To-Speech for the Timer| We should have a voice alert for the timer. You're not looking at your screen. A 1 minute and timer alert would be good. | Since we have a timer in our application, it would be helpful to have some call-out (preferrably at 1 minute remaining and when the timer is completed). Users are usually trying to multitask while waiting on something to finish (e.g. water boiling). This removes the concern of having to pay attention to the time or losing track of time. | **High** |  
| Shuffling Recipe Cards | The name is pretty self explanatory- clicking shuffle randomizes the order of recipes on the page. | Combined with filtering, this would be powerful for users who know what they have in their kitchen but don't know what to eat. | **High** |
| Light/Dark Mode | Allow the user to switch between light and dark mode. | We need to think about this in advance for CSS variables. A list for dark mode and a list for light mode. Overall, it'd be a good acceessibility feature for a user who needs a low or high amount of light. | **High**|
| Autocomplete | Utilize the `autocomplete` attribute of the `<form>` tag to allow users to see autocomplete candidates for 1) inputting ingredients for a new recipe and 2) searching for recipes. The autocomplete array should be based on the ingredients the user has historically used and what recipes the user has. | This kills two birds with one stone: we have been a little lost on how to approach the search bar and having autocomplete for ingredient input will reduce redundancy when creating recipes. | **High** |

### Existing Ideas
| Interest Item | Notes | Status |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ingredients List | Change it to include the number of ingredients and its measurement | **To change** |
| Calories | We might want to scrap this idea since its complicated. For our audience, it's not really relevant. Maybe we want to make it an optional thing? Leave it as an option, but we'll ignore it if it's blank. | |
| Timer Placement | That should be separate and not in each step. | |
| Tagging and Filtering | Preset list of tags. Display dietary tags on the home screen. Leave out ingredient tags on the home. | |

## Pros & Cons
Based on our decision, what are the tradeoffs we acknowledge?

### Pros
- We're not completely scrapping ideas as a lot of the low priority items we have identified are "That'd be nice to have, but let's focus on other things first."
- Priorities give us a sense of what is important for our current vision. Discucssing each feature's tradeoffs gives us a better perspective of what each feature does or does not provide. 

### Cons
- We have to be careful about timeboxing. If we just limit ourselves to the high priority tasks, we might not get the chance to explore medium and low priority features.
