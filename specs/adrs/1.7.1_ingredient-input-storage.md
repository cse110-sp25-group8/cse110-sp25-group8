## Context/Problem
On our "create recipe" page, we initially had one input field for each ingredient. However, this introduces a lot of problems if we want to expand upon features that deal with ingredients such as unit conversion (metric <-> imperial) and recipe portion scaling. Doing it this way would also introduce the problem of string parsing and all of the various edge cases.

## Options Considered
- One input field + string parsing
  - Custom string parser
  - Regex
- Three input fields (quantity, unit, and ingredient name)

## Decision & Outcome
We'll go with **three input fields** where we have one (1) for quantity, one (1) for the units, and one (1) for the actual name of the ingredient. For now, we'll start off with providing a list of units in the **metric** system.

## Pros & Cons
Based on our decision, what are the tradeoffs we acknowledge?

### Pros
- We force the input to be formatted into a method that's easiest for us to extract and manipulate. There are a lot less variations for us to deal with. Taking into consideration of all of the variations combined, this creates a lot of headaches as to how exactly we need to parse input. Such variations include:
  - Unitless ingredients versus ingredients with units
    - `2 eggs`
    - `1/2 cup of water`
  - Different unit entries
    - `5 teaspoons` vs `5 TSP` vs `5tsp` vs `5 tspn`
      - Some people might use the full word, shorthand name, or not know what the actual shorthand name is. 
  - Different ways of typing quantities
    - `1/2` or `1 / 2` (fractional)
    - `0.5` (decimal) 
- Separating each component individually allows us to manipulate the data with ease. For example, if we want to implement unit conversion, we read the `unit` value and scale the `quantity` accordingly. If we want to scale the portion size, we scale `quantity` with the desired number of portions.

### Cons
- There is more input friction for the user. Rather than allowing the user to input "freestyle," the user has to ensure all three fields are filled.
  - This adds more validation on our end.
  - We could remedy the input friction by allowing users to automatically move to the next field when they press "ENTER" or some sort, but this is likely something we have to consider in a hypothetical future as the project end is nearing.
