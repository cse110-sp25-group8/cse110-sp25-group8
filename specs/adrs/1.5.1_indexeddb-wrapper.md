## Context/Problem
While we got approval to use IndexedDB, we did not get immediate approval for the Dexie wrapper. After consulting Professor Powell, he said we should make a proof of concept (POC) with Dexie to show that our team has a need for it. Given the current timeline of the project, we were left with two options: 1) Follow Professor Powell's advice and make and demo a POC or 2) Follow Rashi's advice in making a custom interface first.

## Options Considered
  - Dexie
  - Custom, self-implemented interface

## Decision & Outcome
We'll continue with our own interface.

## Pros & Cons
Based on our decision, what are the tradeoffs we acknowledge?

### Pros
- We control it all and don't depend on other people's code.
- We don't have to worry about a byte payload.

### Cons
- Takes too much time when we're on limited time. 
- We have to write the interface and get it right.
