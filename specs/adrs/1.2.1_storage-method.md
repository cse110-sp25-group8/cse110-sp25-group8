## Context/Problem
For our project, we will need some form of storage method for our recipes. As we've discussed, localStorage is too limiting for our project. While we do want to utilize IndexedDB for its indexing abilities, the API for it is verbose and will be a challenge for us to learn. However, Professor Powell has suggested a wrapper for it: Dexxie.

## Options Considered
- localStorage (the problem)
- IndexedDB
  - Dexxie

### IndexedDB
- We can use a wrapper such as Dexie to avoid the verbosity of IndexedDB's API. This would ease the learning curve for us while being able to use IndexedDB's power to index.
