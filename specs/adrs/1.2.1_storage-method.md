## Context/Problem
For our project, we will need some form of storage method for our recipes. As we've discussed, localStorage is too limiting for our project. While we do want to utilize IndexedDB for its indexing abilities, the API for it is verbose and will be a challenge for us to learn. However, Professor Powell has suggested a wrapper for it: Dexie.

## Options Considered
- localStorage (the problem)
- IndexedDB
  - Dexie

### IndexedDB
- We can use a wrapper such as Dexie to avoid the verbosity of IndexedDB's API. This would ease the learning curve for us while being able to use IndexedDB's power to index.

## Decision & Outcome
We have decided to use Dexie.js as a wrapper for IndexedDB. This allows us to harness the power of IndexedDB without having to deal with complexity and verbosity of it's native API. Dexie offers much more developer-friendly interface, especially for our team's needs and timeline. 

## Pros & Cons
Based on our decision, what are the tradeoffs we acknowledge?

### Pros
- We get significantly more storage capacity then localStorage, which is limited around 5MB (but IndexedDB has limitless storage, depending on user's device).
- Indexed quaries allows us for efficient search and retrieval of the data
- Unlike localStorage, which is synchronous (blocking), IndexedDB is asynchronous, meaning it doesnâ€™t freeze the UI while processing.
- Compare to localStorage which stores data as string, indexedDB is way more reliable.
- IndexedDB supports binary data (like Blobs) making it much more versatile for storing things like images.
- Dexie abstracts away bolierplate code, making IndexDB much more easier to work with.
### Cons
- We still need to learn how to use Dexie and understand IndexedDB's data model which could be possible timesink.
- Learning concept like `async` calls or `Promises` whould be also potential learning curve.
- Asynchronous behavior means unpredictable behavior, so it might be more challenging to debugging.
